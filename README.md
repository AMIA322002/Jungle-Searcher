# Jungle-Searcher
Program Navigation Simulation Using Java 
●	Established a program simulation (GUI) using random numbers and graphs to simulate a scenario to navigate in searching for people in a jungle or a city.
●	Designed the graphical user interface (GUI) enabling users to interact with the simulation. This entailed creating buttons, text fields, and graphical elements such as graphs.
●	Developed the code to simulate the scenario of navigating and searching for people. Tasks included generating random numbers, creating representations of the jungle or city, and simulating the movement of people or search teams.
●	Utilized Java's random number generation utilities to simulate unpredictable elements of the scenario, such as the locations of people or obstacles in the jungle or city.
●	Integrated graph as necessary to visually represent the jungle or city environment, along with the movement of search teams and people.
